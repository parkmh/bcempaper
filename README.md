# Block Circulant Embedding Method (BCEM)
# Introduction
The `block circulant embedding method` (BCEM) is a method for sampling from
stationary Gaussian random field on a grid which is not regular but has a
regular block structure which is often the case in applications. It was introduced in a paper titled "*A Block Circulant Embedding Method for Simulation of Stationary Gaussian Random Fields on Block-regular Grids*" by M. Park and M.V. Tretyakov.
